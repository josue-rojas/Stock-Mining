Mining stock names from google.com/finance and getting basic stats information. Basically building a database. The point of this is to be used in a bigger project. Knowing and being able to see many stocks in order of desired parameters is part of it.

So far I have just implemented mining from google finance and basic stats like linear regression slope, 52 week high, and 52 week low.

Next steps is to focus on adding more stats informations. This while trying to implemented everything in a database and possibly show it off in a website or some other form of visual display.
